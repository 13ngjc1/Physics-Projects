This project is a Brownian simulation of particles in a box in a heatbath, complete with kinetic energy, potential energy and temperature recorded on a .csv file.

This simulation includes collisions with box boundaries, collision with other particles with Centre of Mass adjusted. Initial velocity of each particle is completely random
and is determined by a BoxMullerTransform function.

Autocorrelation is also added, using mean squared displacement.

To see full animation of the results run the coord.xyz on VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics).
