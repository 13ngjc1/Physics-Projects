# All Projects

Including computational physics and finance projects.

Computational Physics projects, with "lab" in the file name, are all projects I have completed while studying in CUHK's Computational Physics course. The course requires students to complete various simulations and verification of some physics law, and ususally must be ran with VMD (visual molecular dynamics) software with the coord.xyz file attached in each directory.

I only upload fully completed computational physics projects.

All the finance projects are done out of my own interests and are under development.
