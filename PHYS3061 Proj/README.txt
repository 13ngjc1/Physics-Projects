This is an attempted project at simulating the Alpha Centauri binary star system

The Python script was written with Python 3 (Anaconda distribution) on Jupyter notebook and Spyder.

Best to run on spyder or other non-Jupyter notebook IDEs.

Each script simulate three different scenarios but should all produce a graph with a trail and a dot representing its final position.

Script does not require any inputs.

Excel raw data was extracted by Spyder's variable explorer.
